### Nice to meet you! I'm Sarah :)

👩‍💻 I'm a junior at Columbia University studying CS

🔭 I'm also a SWE @ Ball Aerospace working on a mission planning system for a future satellite, and I have experience developing various astronomy observation tools

💌 More recently, I have been exploring tech in the fashion industry, and I'm excited to learn more about the roles of computer vision and cloud computing in this field!
